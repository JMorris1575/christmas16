Hi <name>,

Our family Christmas website is ready to go, and with a couple of new features this year too.

As last year, go to christmas.jmorris.webfactional.com and log in with the username and password listed for you below:

username: <username>

password: <password>

I had to make longer passwords this year. The system didn't seem to allow shorter ones and, who knows, it may help prevent this site's e-mail from being hacked again this year!

Don't let anyone know your username and password or they may try to steal your gift!

As always, anyone who can make it is invited to the house in Kalamazoo on Christmas day. I will distribute as many gifts as I can then and mail the rest after Christmas.

If you know someone who didn't get this e-mail but should have, or if you find out you can't log in with the information above, or if you have anyother question, let me know at jmorris@ecybermind.net.

Merry Christmas to you all!

Love,

Jim
