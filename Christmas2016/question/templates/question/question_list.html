            Janet has provided ten conversational questions for us to answer. A new question will appear (almost) every
            day until December 23. The questions that have appeared so far are displayed below. You can respond to any
            of the questions that have appeared so far, or edit your previous responses. Respond by clicking on the
            Respond button below. After you have responded you can edit (or delete) your response by clicking on
            the Edit My Response button that will appear in its place.
